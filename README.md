# The-ML-Toolkit
This project aims to build a library consisting of popular machine learning algorithms from scratch and their real-time implementation (with its details). The library covers the major algorithms of both Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning. The library contains the following popular algorithms: Linear Regression (and Polynomial Regression), Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, and NLayered Neural Network. The implementation has to be done â€˜from scratch' which means using only libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib apart from the built-in Python libraries. The models will be trained and tested based on the given datasets to validate their performance. A detailed report has to be prepared, which will document all methodologies, experiments, and decisions, including rejected approaches with justifications taken during the construction of the algorithms.
